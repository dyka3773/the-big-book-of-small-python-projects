At the time of reading this book and this project, I was also working on a sticker album for the EURO 2024 tournament. 
I thought it would be fun to apply the concept of the Birthday Paradox to my sticker collection. 
The idea is to calculate how many stickers I need to buy to complete the album and how many duplicates I might end up with.
